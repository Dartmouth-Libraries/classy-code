# Classy Code: Object-Oriented Programming for Fun and Profit

An introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with examples in Python.

## Session description
Have you ever gotten lost in a maze-like piece of code you wrote? Are you interested in going beyond the basics of programming and learning more about how you can design and structure a robust, extensible, and easy-to-read program?

This workshop will introduce you to the paradigm of Object-Oriented Programming. We will introduce the main philosophy behind it, discuss use cases, show its limitations, and work through a variety of examples hands-on.

Participants are introduced to the basic principles of OOP, will learn about objects, classes, fields, and methods, and work through a series of hands-on examples in Python (although the concepts apply to any language supporting OOP). Finally, we will take a look at some reusable templates called design patterns that can be applied in a number of different contexts.

## Getting started

### Requirements
You should have some experience with programming in any language. Experience in Python will be particularly helpful, since we will work through some examples in Python.

### Usage
The repo has the following structure:
- `ppt`: The slide deck used in the introduction
- `img`: Images used in the notebooks
- `code`: Notebooks going over the most important OOP concepts with code examples
