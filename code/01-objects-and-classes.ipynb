    "\n",
    "At least, however, the class needs to define what happens when it a new object of this class is created. This is done in a special method that is implicitly called when an object is instantiated. Some languages (e.g., C++, Java) call this special method the _constructor_. In Python, it is a function called `__init__()`. Because of the double underscores, methods like this are called _dunder_ methods in Python. They are special methods that allow objects to interact with the built-in functions in and operators in the language. For example, by defining the `__init__()` dunder method, we can determine what happens when the object is initialized (i.e., during instantiation).\n",

    "**Note:** In Python, every (non-static) method gets passed a reference to its parent object as the first argument. We therefore have to define every method with at least one parameter. By convention, the first parameter is called `self`. It's a common mistake to forget that the first parameter is always this self-reference, especially when there are multiple parameters in a method!\n",
