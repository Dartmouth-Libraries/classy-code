    "Design patterns are template solutions you can use for recurring problems in software design. They are independent of programming languages, although some languages may make their implementation easier. Because of their very nature, design patterns are very abstract and realizing that a problem lends itself to a particular design pattern can be challenging. Using design patterns, however, allows adopting a common \"design language\" that can be easily understood by other programmers familiar with the pattern looking at your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns have a long history, but the 1994 book _\"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\"_ by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (known as the Gang of Four) largely influenced how people think about them today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book defines three types of patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creational\n",
    "\n",
    "- Patterns dealing with the creation of objects beyond simple instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural\n",
    "\n",
    "- Patterns concerning class composition to achieve specific functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavioral\n",
    "\n",
    "- Patterns concerned with the communication or interaction between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Design patterns are not without criticism. Some people consider them mere workarounds for missing features in a programming language. While this may be true in some cases, it does not mean they are not useful, and knowing them can help to understand advanced language features more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gang of Four lists 23 patterns in their book. Since we cannot cover all of them in this notebook, we will focus one one from each type. You can check out the rest of them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns#Patterns_by_type).\n"
